What Do I Do Next?
------------------

Once you have a virtual environment running, you can start making changes to
the sample Java web application. We suggest making a small change to
/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/index.jsp first, so you can see how changes
pushed to your project's repository are automatically picked up by your project
pipeline and deployed to the Amazon EC2 instance. (You can watch the pipeline
progress on your project dashboard.) Once you've seen how that works, start
developing your own code, and have fun!

To run your tests locally, go to the root directory of the sample code and run the
`mvn clean compile test` command, which AWS CodeBuild also runs through your `buildspec.yml` file.

To test your new code during the release process, modify the existing tests or add tests
to the tests directory. AWS CodeBuild will run the tests during the build stage of your
project pipeline. You can find the test results in the AWS CodeBuild console.

How Do I Add Template Resources to My Project?
------------------

To add AWS resources to your project, you'll need to edit the `template.yml`
file in your project's repository. You may also need to modify permissions for
your project's worker roles. After you push the template change, AWS CodeStar
and AWS CloudFormation provision the resources for you.

See the AWS CodeStar user guide for instructions to modify your template:

What Should I Do Before Running My Project in Production?
------------------

AWS recommends you review the security best practices recommended by the framework
author of your selected sample application before running it in production. You
should also regularly review and apply any available patches or associated security
advisories for dependencies used within your application.
